Things that are missing in Chrome Developer Tools for a person used to Firebug.

JavaScript Error Count
Knowing that there are JavaScript errors straight away is a very useful feature. In Firebug you'll get an error count of all kinds of errors that you chose Firebug to report on. So it can so not only JS errors but also network errors. It's useful because you'll know straight away that there are some broken images. Chrome dev tools misses this feature.
 I found a plugin called JSError that partially fixes that by showing JS error count but it won't for example show network errors - and it doesn't work on Linux.
 (can be added by a plugin called JSError)
Search across multiple js files
Multi-line console
